## Satisfiability Solver
Assignment for 6.1010 Fundamentals of Programming (MIT, Spring 2023)

SAT_Writeup.pdf in the root directory contains the instructions for this assignment. Within the sat folder, lab.py contains the code I wrote and submitted.

For this assignment, I was tasked with coding a satisfiability solver. CNF formulas would be fed into the satisfying_assignment() function and a dictionary of variable assignments would be returned.
